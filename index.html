<p> I studied it at my school.It's called Durham School Dubai.Our teacher helped us to do our very first website.</p>
<p>This skill will help us in our adult life if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone in our job or friend asks to create a website.</li>
  <li>You will need to do a website to provide information for the whole world.</li>
  <li>You want to do a popular website which will advertise something and you will get money and etc.</li>
